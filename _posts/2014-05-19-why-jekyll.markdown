I've been wanting to start a coding blog for awhile. It's not that I do anything groundbreaking, earthshattering, or really even all that *interesting* to most people, I more wanted somewhere just to keep a record of all the cool things I try out in my spare time, and really, really cool things I do professionally. 

One of the things that pulled me towards development is that I have a short attention span. I get tired of things quickly. I might not even finish this post (I wish I was joking).

I write Java professionally, working on the Adobe AEM platform. Java is fun, sure, but at the end of the workday I don't want to look at Java anymore. But, I still have that desire to build things with code. Because really, there's not much more thrilling than writing a bunch of code, running it and then seeing your results. Even if the code is just something stupid like a Ruby Gem that just runs and insults your friends. [Yes, I did this.][toddrules] 

So, in my spare time I go down the rabbit hole of trying out new things. I've played with Ruby, Node.js, Go, Python. Really, I have more languages and frameworks installed on my laptop than I'll probaly ever get around to trying out. I have 5 or 6 different text editors (though, Sublime is still my favorite), about the same amount of IDEs (I'm an IntelliJ man, though). I read [Hacker News][hackernews], see the announcement of something new and go and install it and play with it. 

Is this ever useful? [Sometimes][sinatra], and [sometimes][go], but [not always][node]. 

Where was I going with this? I have no idea. I've been up since 5am, I'm on a plane and the woman in front of me spilled a large bottle of water all over my backpack. That has nothing to do with this, but it certainly sucked. I had teabags in there. They are ruined. They were good teabags, too. Luckily my computer and iPad were ok, because important things. *IMPORTANT THINGS.*

Anyway, I recently saw a post on Hacker News about [Jekyll][jekyll] and thought it looked interesting. As I said before, I've wanted to do a code blog for awhile, and as a big nerdy developer type the idea of a. hosting it directly in my [github repo][github] and b. building the blog myself. Granted, I am currently using the default theme for the blog, and will probably end up just installing another already built theme (I'm not much of a designer type, and CSS is my achilles heel), but this is still *mine*. I don't have to put up with Wordpress's crap, or Blogger's crap, or any other that other crap. It's mine, and I can do with it as I please. 

Plus, it's free with Github pages. So, that's pretty great as well. Plus, Jekyll is made to work with Github pages, all I do is commit and push and BOOM. New blogpost for your eyeholes. 

Lastly, it's giving me a reason to learn markdown (albeit a flavored version of markdown). I've been wanting to learn markdown for awhile, and so far it's pretty nice. [I've found this resource to be invaluable][markdown]. 

Enjoy your day, my blog, and hopefully something delicious for lunch. I'm planning on getting some BBQ.
