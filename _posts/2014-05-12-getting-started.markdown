Hello there. 

I'm Todd, and this is my blog.

I'm a software developer who develops on the Adobe AEM platform. I write Java professionally, but outside of work I am pretty all over the place with languages/frameworks. Currently I'm learning Ruby on Rails in my spare time. 

This blog will just be me spilling my guts about whatever development tool I am loving at the moment. 

This is obviously (well, I suppose obvious if you use Jekyll) built with Jekyll. Currently using the default theme, which I will begin customizing out (and probably *blogging* about).

Expect a blog post about Jekyll as well. It's a pretty cool framework and I'll probably write all about my experience throwing this together eventually. 

*fin*
