Hello there. 

I'm Todd, and this is my blog.

I'm a software developer who develops on the Adobe AEM platform. I write Java professionally, but outside of work I am pretty all over the place with languages/frameworks. Currently I'm learning Ruby on Rails in my spare time. 

This blog will just be me spilling my guts about whatever development tool I am loving at the moment.
